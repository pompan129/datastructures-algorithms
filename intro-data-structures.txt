1) A line of people at an amusement park ride.

- The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
- There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
- When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
- People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those behind them take their place.
- Given the above real-world information, use an array data structure to code the following solution.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.
c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).
d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?
e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?
f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

My Code......

let line = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

//add a new person to end
const addPerson=(person,line)=>{
   line.push(person);
   return line;
}

//Find a person
const findPerson=(person)=>{
  const index = line.indexOf(person) 
  return index === -1? false:index;
} 

//insert person in middle
const insertPerson=(person, before, line)=>{
  const index = line.indexOf(before);
  line.splice(index,0,person);
  return line;
}

//remove person from line
const removePerson = (person, line)=>{
 line = line.filter(name=>name!==person);
 return line;
}

console.log(addPerson("Mary",line)); //[ 'Vivian', 'Ava', 'Josh', 'Patrick', 'Mike', 'Mary' ]
console.log(findPerson("Josh",line)); //2
console.log(findPerson("Emily",line)); //false
console.log(insertPerson("Melissa","Ava",line)); //[ 'Vivian', 'Melissa', 'Ava', 'Josh', 'Patrick', 'Mike', 'Mary' ]
console.log(removePerson("Patrick",line)); //[ 'Vivian', 'Melissa', 'Ava', 'Josh', 'Mike', 'Mary' ]

2) Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

I could model a class in an college or other educational facility with a data structure. I would most likely use an Object for this. 
There could be key value pairs for the title and teacher. I would use an array of objects for the students.

3) How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

I would have to create methods to add and remove students from the class. I would also need methods for changing the class title and 
adding and removing teachers. The list of students might work a lot like the "line" at the grocery store we modeled in the first problem.
