__Short Answer__

1) Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a way for programmers to brainstorm about a propblem in a language agnostic way. It allows them to reason about a problem in a purley loogical way without getting bogged down in language syntax or specific enviornmental quirks.


2) If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

You would likely get an error. Pseudocode will not run on an actual machine. It is a language for aproaching problems not a programming language. Like a flow chart it sigguests an approach but does not actually impliment a solution.



__Programming Assignment__
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1) Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number
  store first number in max
ELSE
   store second number in max
PRINT max

2) Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET number equal to 1
WHILE the number is less than or equal to 100
  PRINT number
  ADD 1 to number
END WHILE


3) Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

GET phonebookArray
GET searchID
SET item to element in phonebookArray
WHILE item ID does not equal searchID && not at end of phonebookArray
  IF item ID is equal to searchID
    return item
  ELSE
    increment to next element in phonebookArray
END WHILE
return "Not Found"

4) Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

I created a repl.it @  https://repl.it/@fazbat/phonebook

//Code------------------

  const phoneBook = [
  {
    name: "Bob Johnson", number:"916-455-1234"
  },
  {
    name: "Mary Berry", number:"456-897-3333"
  },
  {
    name: "Tom Thumb" , number: "234-332-8879"
  },
  {
    name:"Harry Smith" , number:"333-899-0005"
  },
  {
    name: "Jessie Hugh", number:"666-453-8123"
  },
  {
    name:"Donald Duck" , number:"987-888-4567"
  },
  {
    name: "Yosemite Sam" , number:"775-123-7745"
  },
  {
    name: "Bugs Bunny" , number:"284-897-3939"
  },
]

function findByName(name){
  for(let x=0;x<phoneBook.length;x++){
    if(name === phoneBook[x].name){return phoneBook[x]}
  }
  return false
}

console.log(findByName("Harry Smith") || "not found")
console.log(findByName("Tome Jones") || "not found")
