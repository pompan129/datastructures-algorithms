1) What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Linear search can be used where list contains random data. Some examples might be asking everyone in a line at the airport if 
they are the ones who own a lost bag or wallet. Or maybe you go down a list of reservations at a restaurant to see if a particular 
name is on the list. 

2) What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Binary search only works with sorted data.  Real life scenario might be looking up a word in the dictionary. Or  name in the 
phone book.

3) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using 
linear search?

It would take seven iterations

4) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using 
binary search?

It would take three iterations

5) Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Explain your reasoning.

I would use a linear search. Binary search does not work on unsorted data.

6) Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search?
Explain your reasoning.

I would use binary search.  It would take at most Log base 2 iterations in the worst case. A linear search might take a 
million iterations.



Programming Assignment:

1) You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a 
program to allow you to win the bet.

repl.it @ https://repl.it/@fazbat/binarySearchDictionary

const binarysearch = (word, dictionary) => {
  let low = 0;
  let high = dictionary.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    if (dictionary[mid].toLowerCase() > word.toLowerCase()) {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
    else if  (dictionary[mid].toLowerCase() < word.toLowerCase()){
      low = mid + 1;
    }
    else{return mid}
  }

  return false;
}

const dictionary = ("ajar ,akin ,a la carte ,a la mode ,alarm ,alarm clock ,alarmed ,alarming ,alarmingly ,alarmist ,alas ,"+
"Albatross ,albeit ,albino ,album ,alcohol ,alcoholic ,alcoholism ,alcove ,alderman ,alderwoman").split(' ,');

let index = binarysearch("Albatross" , dictionary)
console.log(index); // 11
console.log(dictionary[index]);//Albatross


2) You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a 
program that will help you net the right fish.

repl.it @ https://repl.it/@fazbat/getFish

const tank = ["black","red","black","black","black","black","black","black","red","black","black","black","black","black","black",
"black","black","black","black","black","black","black","black","black","black","black","black","red","black","white","black",
"black","black","black","black","black","black","red","black","black","black","black","red","black","black","black","black",
"black","black","black"]

const getSpottedFish = (color,tank)=>{
  for(let i = 0; i<tank.length;i++){
    if(tank[i]===color){return `${color} spotted fish in net ${i}`}
  }
    return "Sorry, there are no fish with that coloring."
}

console.log(getSpottedFish('white', tank));//white spotted fish in net 29
console.log(getSpottedFish('purple', tank));//Sorry, there are no fish with that coloring.
